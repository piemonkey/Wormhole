# Wormhole

A slightly odd game written using [Processing](https://processing.org/). An
experiment with physics engines, algorithmic graphics creation and
audio analysis.

You control a wormhole, the aim is to collect the boxes which appear in time
with the music before they turn red and explode while avoiding sucking up the
droid. It lacks any sort of plot or justification for the situation, if you
think of one, please let me know.

This was made as a project for the "Creative Programming for Digital Media &
Mobile Apps" course from [Goldsmiths, University of London on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/london) and is heavily modified from one of their
examples.

## Quick Start

Written for Processing 2.2.1 and only compatable with the JavaScript mode.

Simply [download Processing](https://processing.org/download/), install, make
sure the git repository is in a directory named 'Wormhole' (requirement of
Processing) then load the .pde file. Make sure you're in JavaScript mode and hit
play.
